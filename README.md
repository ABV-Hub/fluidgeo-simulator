# fluidgeo-simulator: what is it?
FEM simulator of fluid-geomechanics coupling in unconventional petroleum reservoirs.
## Purpose
The ideia is a construction of unconventional reservoir simulator under the finite element method.
The coding structure is based on The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis (Thomas Hughes).
The current code uses modular paradigm of programming.
## Uses
The use is free, but please pay attention to GNU License before usage. And, of course, credit the authors when using our code, that
has been developed at LNCC/MCTI (National Laboratory of Scientific Computing, Petr√≥polis/Brazil).
